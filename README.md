# NITA 21.7

Welcome to NITA 21.7.

NITA is an open source platform for automating the building and testing of complex networks. 

# History

NITA was developed by a small team of Professional Services consultants at Juniper Networks in 2015 and it has been fed and watered by them ever since. In 2020 it was open sourced and made available on GitHub to allow anyone in the industry to use for free and to contribute to if they wished.

# What Does NITA Do?

As a platform, NITA comprises some of the best Automation tools currently available, such as:

* Ansible, for configuration change management
* Jenkins, for automation and job control
* Robot Framework, for test automation
* Docker, for packaging and easy deployment

In a nutshell, NITA can be used as a toolbox from which you can automate the deployment and testing of very complex networks. It is vendor neutral and so can be used to build and test networks from all of the leading vendors in the market. And because it is a toolbox it can be extended to include any other tool that you may need.
